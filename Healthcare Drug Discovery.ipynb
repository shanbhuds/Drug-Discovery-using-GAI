    "- Doctors must study the particular associations between drugs, diseases, and proteins published in other papers and clinical studies\n",
    "- They have to find out what the target for the drug should be, i.e., which protein it should bind with;\n",

    "- During the initial stage of identifying the lead molecules, we cannot be sure of anything\n",
    "- Live experiments in the lab are still very slow and expensive, so we would like to find lead molecules as accurately as we can. \n",
    "- Even if the goal is to treat cancer there is no hope to check the entire endless variation of small molecules in the lab\n",
    "- 72 million is just the size of a specific database, the total number of small molecules is estimated to be between 10⁶⁰ and 10²⁰⁰\n",
    "- synthesizing and testing a single new molecule in the lab may cost thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. \n",
    "- The early guessing stage is really, really important.\n",
    "- We can use machine learning models to try and choose the molecules that are most likely to have desired properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When you have 72 million of something, “choosing” stops looking like classification and starts looking like “generation” We have to generate a molecule from scratch, a promising candidate for a drug. We can stop searching for a needle in a haystack and design perfect needles instead:\n",

    "- The chemical language model was trained on a Smiles file containing 1.4 million molecules from the ChEMBL database, which contains molecules and measured biological activity data. \n",
    "- They employed a recurrent neural network with three stacked LSTM layers, each with 1024 dimensions, and each one followed by a dropout[65] layer, with a dropout ratio of 0.2, to regularise the neural network.\n",
    "- To generate novel molecules, 50,000,000 Smiles symbols were sampled from the model symbol-by-symbol.\n",
    "- After filtering out duplicates, they obtained 847,955 novel molecules.\n",

    "- AtomNet’s application of local convolutional filters to structural target information successfully predicts new active molecules for targets with no previously known modulators\n",
    "- The network topology consists of an input layer, followed by multiple 3D-convolutional and fully-connected layers, and topped by a logistic-cost layer that assigns probabilities over the active and inactive classes.\n",

    "-  GANs also makes sense for some other relatively “continuous” kinds of data. \n",
    "- But molecules? The atomic structure is totally not continuous, and GANs are notoriously hard to train for discrete structures. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Researchers presented an architecture for generating lead molecules based on a variation of the GAN idea called Adversarial Autoencoders (AAE). \n",
    "- In AAE, the idea is to learn to generate objects from their latent representations.\n",
    "- Autoencoders are neural architectures that take an object as input and try to return the same object as output. \n",
    "- In the middle of the architecture, the input must go through a middle layer that learns a latent representation, i.e., a set of features that encode the input in such a way that afterwards subsequent layers can decode the object back\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*ovqbOqz_q6FERZCn. \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Either the middle layer is simply smaller (has lower dimension) than input and output, or the autoencoder uses special regularization techniques, but in any case it’s impossible to simply copy the input through all layers, and the autoencoder has to extract the really important stuff.\n",
    "- They took a conditional adversarial autoencoder and trained it to generate fingerprints of molecules, using and serving desired properties as conditions. \n",

    "\n",
    "- There is a discriminator that tries to distinguish the distribution of latent representations from some standard distribution\n",
    "- If you can make the distribution of latent codes indistinguishable from some standard distribution, it means that you can then sample from this distribution and generate reasonable samples through the decoder\n",
    "- There is also a condition that in this case encodes desired properties of the molecule; we train on the molecules with known properties, and the problem is then to generate molecules with desired (perhaps even never before seen) combinations of properties.\n",
    "- A simple screening of the database can find molecules with the fingerprints most similar to generated ones.\n",
